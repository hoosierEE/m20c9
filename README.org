* Split Wireless Keyboard

  Minimal keyboard with 30 mechanical keyswitches (Cherry MX Clear), plus a cluster of capacitive buttons for use by both thumbs.
  Left and right halves are completely separate from each other, and can be used independently.
  The halves communicate with each other through wireless UART, and commuincate with the host OS as a Bluetooth HID keyboard.
