* Layout for a small keyboard
Minimal keyboard with 30 mechanical keyswitches (Cherry MX Clear), plus a cluster of capacitive buttons for use by both thumbs.

Modifiers inherit from the =Default= layer, overriding individual keys as needed.

| Held-down modifier: | none    | Shift   | Layer1  | Layer2 | Layer3  | Layer4  |
|---------------------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+---------|
| Layer Used:         | Default | Shifted | Numeric | Symbol | Default | Default |

* Capacitive Keys (Modifiers)
These include all the modifiers (Shift, L*) as well as space, tab, enter, and backspace.  Note that since no keymap is specified for =Layer 3= and =Layer 4=, they use the =Default= layer.

| Tab     | Backspace |   | Space   | Enter  |
| Meta    | Alt       |   |         | Esc    |
| Layer 4 | Layer 3   |   | Numeric | Symbol |

There are 9 capacitive switches on the Teensy 3.x, so they must be used wisely.  Capacitve buttons are easier to hold down for long periods of time so they're good candidates for modifiers and keys that are pressed very frequently.  I opted to give =Space= its own dedicated capacitive key for aesthetic reasons (it's quieter).
